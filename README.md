# charging — cheapest public EV charger nearby

A service that ingests open EV-charging data from Belgium's National Access
Point and answers two questions:

1. **Where is the cheapest *available* public charger near me?**
2. **How has a charger's ad-hoc price changed over time?** (statistics)

## Why this exists / where the data comes from

Under **AFIR Article 20** (Regulation EU 2023/1804), since **2025-04-14** every
Belgian CPO with paid public/semi-public chargers must publish static **and**
dynamic data — location, connectors, power, real-time availability, and the
**ad-hoc price** — free of charge via open APIs, catalogued on the National
Access Point **[transportdata.be](https://www.transportdata.be/)**. Most feeds
speak **OCPI** (DATEX II becomes mandatory 2026-04-14).

The NAP is a *catalogue of per-CPO endpoints*, not one unified API, so we
aggregate the feeds ourselves. The first wired source is **EnergyVision**
(OCPI 2.1.1). See **[Getting real data](#getting-real-data)**.

> Ad-hoc price ≠ per-charge-card price. AFIR mandates the drive-up price, which
> is the fairest basis for comparison. Per-MSP/card tariffs (e.g. a Mobiflow
> card) would require a commercial source like the Chargeprice API.

## Key design decisions

- **Prices change rarely → temporal versioning (SCD Type 2), not snapshots.**
  A new `tariff_version` row is written **only when the tariff content changes**
  (detected via an order-independent content hash). The history table stays
  tiny; "current price" is a single indexed row; "price at time T" is a
  temporal range query.
- **Manufactured history.** The OCPI feeds only ever expose the *current*
  tariff. We build history by polling and recording observed changes — see
  the honesty rules below.
- **Availability is current-only** (overwritten each poll), by design. Price is
  historized; occupancy is not.
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** for geo ("nearby" via `ST_DWithin` + KNN), relational
  data, and temporal history in one store.
- **Comparable price across realistic sessions.** Raw OCPI tariffs mix €/kWh,
  €/min and session fees, so they aren't directly sortable. We price a set of
  **10 realistic charging sessions** (see below) into `comparable_prices` jsonb,
  plus a single headline `comparable_price_eur` for the default sort. This makes
  AC and DC chargers comparable and "cheapest" well-defined — and lets a user
  ask "cheapest for *my* kind of session".
- **Store layer uses pgx directly** (not sqlc): PostGIS `geography` + `numeric`
  fight code generation, and explicit geo expressions/casts are cleaner.

### Running continuously (unattended)

The `ingest` scheduler is built to run 24/7:

- **Two cadences:** availability is polled frequently (`status_cron`, default
  every 3 min) via the Locations feed; price/tariff diffs run rarely
  (`poll_cron`, default daily). The full pass also refreshes availability.
- **Staleness:** availability older than `AVAILABILITY_STALE_AFTER` (default
  15 min) is treated as *unknown* — excluded from `available=true` and flagged
  `availability_stale` — so a dead feed never masquerades as "free".
- **Overlap-safe:** a pass is skipped if the previous one of the same job is
  still running (no pile-ups).
- **Hot registry reload:** the scheduler re-reads the `cpo` table every 5 min,
  so enabling or adding a source takes effect without a restart.
- **Graceful shutdown:** on SIGINT/SIGTERM it waits for in-flight passes.
- **Observability:** Prometheus `/metrics` (runs, rows, changes, duration,
  last-success timestamp per CPO+kind) and an API `/readyz` that fails if any
  enabled source has no recent successful availability/price ingest.

### Data honesty rules (so statistics stay credible)

- `observed_from`/`observed_to` are *when we saw the change*, not the CPO's real
  change time. OCPI `last_updated` is kept as `source_last_updated` when given.
- A CPO endpoint being down is a **gap**, never "price removed" or "free".
- "No tariff published" is distinct from "price = €0" (the former records no
  version at all).

## Architecture

```
cmd/ingest   poller binary: -once (cron/CI) or in-process scheduler
cmd/api      HTTP API: cheapest-nearby + price-history

internal/ocpi       OCPI 2.1.1 + 2.2.1 client (discovery, paged Locations+Tariffs)
internal/datex      DATEX II v3 EnergyInfrastructure reader (aggregators)
internal/normalize  OCPI -> canonical model
internal/model      canonical types + tariff content hash
internal/pricing    comparable standard-session price from tariff components
internal/source     CPO registry + token resolution (+ EnergyVision seed)
internal/store      pgx + PostGIS persistence and queries
internal/ingest     change-data-capture engine (hash -> SCD2), run logging
db/migrations       goose schema
```

### Data model (core tables)

- `cpo` — source registry (OCPI base URL, token env var, poll cron, enabled).
- `charger` — one row per connector; `geography(Point,4326)` + GiST index.
- `tariff_version` — append-only history; partial unique index
  `WHERE observed_to IS NULL` guarantees exactly one current row per charger.
- `charger_status` — current availability only.
- `ingest_run` — one row per poll per CPO (rows seen, changes, error).

## Quick start

Requires Docker, Go 1.26+.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make db-up && make db-wait     # start PostGIS
make migrate                   # apply schema
make demo-seed                 # OPTIONAL: fake data so the API returns results
make run-api                   # serve on :8080
```

Then:

```bash
curl 'localhost:8080/healthz'
curl 'localhost:8080/chargers/cheapest?lat=51.0544&lon=3.7251&radius=5000&available=true'
curl 'localhost:8080/chargers/1/price-history'
```

### API

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/healthz` | liveness + DB ping |
| GET | `/readyz` | ready only if every enabled source has recent successful ingests |
| GET | `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics |
| GET | `/sessions` | the 10 comparison sessions for the reference vehicle |
| GET | `/chargers/cheapest` | nearby chargers, cheapest first |
| GET | `/chargers/{id}/price-history` | every recorded tariff version |
| GET | `/stats/overview` | market counts + avg/median price by current type |
| GET | `/stats/sessions` | avg/min/max price per comparison session |
| GET | `/stats/regions?by=city\|postal` | average price per region |
| GET | `/stats/price-trend?months=` | monthly average price over the history |
| GET/POST | `/admin/sources` | list / add sources (admin) |
| POST | `/admin/sources/{id}/enable\|disable` | toggle a source (admin) |
| PUT | `/admin/sources/{id}/token` | set a source token (admin) |
| DELETE | `/admin/sources/{id}` | remove a source (admin) |
| POST | `/admin/ingest/{id}/run?kind=` | trigger an ingestion pass (admin) |
| GET | `/admin/runs` | recent ingestion runs (admin) |

`/admin/*` is the **control plane**: protected by a `ADMIN_TOKEN` bearer
(disabled entirely if `ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset). Token values are never returned
(only `has_token`).

### API/CLI-driven: `chargingctl`

Everything is operable through the API; **`chargingctl` is a thin client over
it (never the DB)** — same contract as the web app. Build with `make build`
(produces `bin/chargingctl`).

```bash
export CHARGING_API=http://localhost:8080 ADMIN_TOKEN=…
chargingctl chargers cheapest --lat 51.05 --lon 3.72 --session charge1080_dc300
chargingctl sessions
chargingctl stats price-trend --months 12
chargingctl sources list
chargingctl runs --cpo energyvision
```

Bringing a source live (e.g. when an OCPI key arrives) is now pure CLI — no SQL:
```bash
chargingctl sources set-token energyvision "$TOKEN"
chargingctl sources enable energyvision
chargingctl ingest run energyvision        # then: chargingctl runs --cpo energyvision
```

`/chargers/cheapest` query params: `lat`, `lon` (required), `radius` (m,
default 5000), `min_power` (kW), `plug` (OCPI standard), `available`
(`true`/`1`), `session` (a profile key — sort & return that session's price),
`limit` (default 50). Without `session`, results are ordered by the headline
`comparable_price_eur`; with one, by that session's price (chargers that can't
serve it sort last). Each result carries the full `comparable_prices` map.

### Comparison sessions

Each charger is priced for 10 realistic sessions: two energy needs (a 100 km
top-up and a 10→80 % charge) at four power tiers (AC 11/22 kW, DC 150/300 kW),
plus a quick urban top-up and an overnight destination charge. Energy is
**metered** (includes charging losses), and DC durations use a **charging-curve
average** (a 150 kW charger averages ~110 kW over 10→80 %), so per-minute
components are billed honestly. A session only applies to a charger that can
deliver it (current type + power tier).

The reference vehicle is configurable (defaults to a mid-size EV, 60 kWh usable,
18 kWh/100 km) via `VEHICLE_USABLE_KWH` and `VEHICLE_CONSUMPTION_KWH100`.

```bash
curl localhost:8080/sessions
# cheapest charger for a 10–80% fast charge on DC:
curl 'localhost:8080/chargers/cheapest?lat=51.0548&lon=3.7260&radius=5000&session=charge1080_dc300'
```

## Deploy (single VM)

Everything ships as one image (`api`, `ingest`, `migrate` binaries on a
distroless base). `docker-compose.prod.yml` runs PostGIS + a one-shot migration
step + the API and ingest services:

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # set source tokens; DATABASE_URL is overridden to the compose DB
make prod-up                # build image, start db -> migrate -> api + ingest
make prod-ps                # status
make prod-logs              # tail
make prod-backup TS=$(date +%F)   # gzip pg_dump into backups/
```

- **Migrations** run automatically on each deploy (embedded in the `migrate`
  binary; api/ingest wait for it via `depends_on: service_completed_successfully`).
- **Restart policy** `unless-stopped` keeps api/ingest alive across crashes and
  reboots; the API container has a self-probing healthcheck (`api -healthcheck`).
- **Metrics** are exposed by the ingest service on `:9090` (not published by
  default; scrape it on the VM or add a port mapping).
- The prod stack uses its own compose project (`charging_prod`) and data volume,
  separate from the local dev DB.

## Getting real data

The EnergyVision feed needs a free OCPI key.

> **ACTION REQUIRED:** email **myevplatform@energyvision.be** to request an OCPI
> API key (granted free / non-discriminatory under AFIR Article 20).

Once you have it:

```bash
echo 'ENERGYVISION_TOKEN=<your-key>' >> .env
# enable the source:
docker compose exec db psql -U charging -d charging \
  -c "UPDATE cpo SET enabled=true WHERE id='energyvision';"

make run-ingest-once   # one pass
# or: make run-ingest  (scheduler; daily per the source's poll_cron)
```

Add more Belgian CPOs by extending `source.Seeds()` (or inserting `cpo` rows)
with their NAP-published OCPI base URLs and token env vars.

## Testing

```bash
make test
```

`internal/pricing` has pure unit tests (incl. off-peak/time-of-day, kWh
thresholds, order-independent hashing). `internal/ingest` has an end-to-end
integration test that runs the whole pipeline against a mock OCPI server and the
PostGIS database, asserting SCD2 behaviour (no new version when unchanged; a new
version + closure on change) and the cheapest-nearby geo query. It **skips
cleanly** if no database is reachable.

## Status & roadmap

Working vertical slice: OCPI client → normalize → comparable pricing → SCD2
storage → cheapest-nearby + history API, proven end-to-end against PostGIS.

Not yet done (natural next steps):
- Live EnergyVision ingestion (blocked only on the API key above).
- More CPO sources; DATEX II reader (mandatory 2026-04-14).
- Recompute the comparable price at request time for time-varying tariffs (the
  stored value uses a fixed reference time for trend comparability).
- Aggregate statistics endpoints (avg €/kWh by region over time).
- Frontend / map UI.
